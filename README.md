•	Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
The primary client was DriverPass, represented by Liam, DriverPass’ owner, and his IT officer Ian.  The two want to create a web-based platform for which their customers can prepare for their driver’s exam, written and on the road testing.

•	What did you do particularly well?
Somethings I did well was in my writing, and explaining the concepts, so long as I understood them.  What I enjoyed about this class was how it let me flex my communication skills.  I enjoyed creating the DFDs, but oftentimes I could not decide what was most important.  What we learned in this class is to not get stuck with the minutia details in the beginning.  Work your way out and slowly cut into it, piece by piece.  This is what made the DFDs so hard.  I saw so many important things I wanted to be as detailed as possible.  However, I had to pull back a little bit but then I felt I left out too much.

•	If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
Probably the DFDs in project 2.  I got in a rush to finish the assignment, mostly due to personal things like “senioritis”, this is my last class before graduation, plus I was offered my first job in IT and start on July 8th.  17 years of retail H-E-double hockey sticks finally over.  
To improve the DFD I would have addressed the gaps in the class diagram.  I kept it incredibly simple, and I feel like much was ignored, such as incorporating a payment system, or the different levels of an “admin”.

•	How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
Our interpretation came from gathering requirements.  You just have to think about it from the user’s point of view.  Liam says to design a website where someone can take a practice test.  That means you want to setup a module where it gives the user a sense of taking an exam.  So, you create this module that works like an online exam, multiple choice, true or false.  All of this must be done in a user-friendly way, such as clicking on an answer, not typing in a letter.
If we do not consider the user’s needs, then they will quickly turn to another site or service.  The goal is not just about giving them the resources, it is about doing it better than everyone else.

•	How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
I did not realize how important DFDs are for designing a system. Up to this point we have only learned about class diagrams, which I understood, but when you combine this class with CS-300, Algorithms, it really explains things.  It is one thing to understand the steps, it is another to explain those steps in a logical way so that a machine can guide its user through it.  Whether that machine, or median, is a piece of software or web browser.  So honestly, I would spend more time on creating clear models for what I am designing.
